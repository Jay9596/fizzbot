# FIZZ_RS
## ABOUT
A Interviewee for the Fizzbot at Noops HQ.  
It solves the question and completes the interview __unbelievably fast__.


## BIO
The Interviewee uses `Rust`.  
To call the interviewee from your laptop, please have a [Rusty setup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and call it via `cargo run`.  
It will start the interview and present a transcript of it.

The Interviewee __talks__ to the Fizzbot using `reqwest`, then uses `serde` to understand the responses and questions.

To test whether it solves things properly, there are samples available with it.  Just ask to verify by calling `cargo test`.
